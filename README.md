# CSharp-DSA Project (or is it???)
A series of tested DSA coded in C#, as a learning project.

Contains:
- DsaConsole (Main Code)
- DsaConsoleTests (Tests... duh...)

Subtracted in two project to keep the main code clean & neat.
This is a project from a non-consistent C# student starting over...

The roadmap is generated by LLMs.

Feel free to **la-copy-pasta** from the source (if needed in a lifetime...)

`DsaConsoleTests/TestModules/foo.cs`
