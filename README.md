# CSharp-DSA Project (or is it???)

> .NET Version: 9.0

A series of tested DSA coded in C#, as a learning project.
C#, because everybody says not good or too hard for DSA...
May get synced with parallel repositories in SQL, Python, Lua or whatever...

Contains:
- DsaConsole (Main Code)
- DsaConsoleTests (Tests... duh...)

Subtracted in two project to keep the main code clean & neat.

This is a project from a non-consistent C# student starting over...

The roadmap is generated by LLMs & I will focus on pure logic (no UI/console-writes).

> _**Caution**_: `<WarningsAsErrors>true</WarningsAsErrors>` exists in both `.csproj` files.
> - Fails the build for any compiler warning (e.g., unused variables, XML doc issues).
> - Forces to fix warnings before merging code.

## Testability
### Path
#### Modules

`DataStructureModules/foo.cs`

`AlgorithmModules/bar.cs`

#### Tests

`Tests/DataStructure/foo.cs`

`Tests/Algorithm/bar.cs`

Test by command:
```bash
# at `CSharp-DSA/`
dotnet test --filter "foo"
```

### Mirroring

Each test file mirrors the main project's namespace:
- `DsaConsole.Modules`
- `DsaCsonsoleTests.TestModules`

## File-Specific Comments
I was & still am not good at commenting & documentation... 

I don't care say whatever you want...

The documentation's format:
```cs
    /// <summary>
    /// Concepts
    ///     - at least 4
    /// Key Practices
    ///     - at least 4
    /// </summary>
```

## Table of Context

Index (in order of development):
1. `Array`
2. `List<T>`
3. `Span<T>`
4. `Strings`
5. `StackQueue`
6. `LinkedList`
7. `Vectors`
