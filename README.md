# CSharp-DSA Project (or is it???)
A series of tested DSA coded in C#, as a learning project.
Contains:
- DsaConsole (Main Code)
- DsaConsoleTests (Tests...)

Subtracted to keep the main code clean & neat.
This is a project from a non-consistent C# student, but starting over...
The roadmap is generated by LLMs.
Feel free to la-copy-pasta from the source (if needed in a lifetime...)

1. Arrays
2. List<T>
