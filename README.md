# CSharp-DSA Project (or is it???)
A series of tested DSA coded in C#, as a learning project.

Contains:
- DsaConsole (Main Code)
- DsaConsoleTests (Tests... duh...)

Subtracted in two project to keep the main code clean & neat.
This is a project from a non-consistent C# student starting over...

The roadmap is generated by LLMs & I will focus on pure logic (no UI/console-writes).

> Caution
> `<WarningsAsErrors>true</WarningsAsErrors>` exists in both `.csproj` files.
>   - Fails the build for any compiler warning (e.g., unused variables, XML doc issues).
>   - Forces to fix warnings before merging code.

Feel free to **la-copy-pasta** from the source (if needed in a lifetime...)

## Testability
### Path

`DsaConsole/Modules/foo.cs`

`DsaConsoleTests/TestModules/foo.cs`

Test by command:
```bash
# at `CSharp-DSA/`
dotnet test --filter "foo"
```

### Mirroring

Each test file mirrors the main project's namespace:
- `DsaConsole.Modules`
- `DsaCsonsoleTests.TestModules`

### File-Specific Comments
I was & still am not good at commenting & documentation... 

I don't care say whatever you want...

The documentation's format:
```cs
    /// <summary>
    /// Concepts
    ///     - 
    /// Key Practices
    ///     - 
    /// </summary>
```

## Table of Context

Index (in order of development):
1. `Arrays`
2. `List<T>`
3. `Span<T>`
